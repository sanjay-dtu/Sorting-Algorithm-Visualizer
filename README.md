# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a simple project to visualize how different sorting algorithms work. I made this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea is to show how sorting happens step by step using animated bars.

 What it does

- It creates random bars (like an array).
- You can choose a sorting algorithm from the menu.
- When you click "Sort", it shows the sorting process visually.
- There's also a simple comparison of time and space complexities for each algorithm.

Sorting Algorithms Included

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Each algorithm is written in a simple way so it’s easy to understand and explain.

 Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 

No libraries or frameworks are used — just plain and simple JS.
